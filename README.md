# Titanic Survival Prediction (Binary Classification)

This project implements a **binary classification model** to predict whether
a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using **Azure Machine Learning Designer**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict passenger survival (**Survived = 1**, **Not Survived = 0**) based on
demographic and travel-related features.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
- Type: Tabular data

### Features Used
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Fare
- Embarked

### Target Variable
- **Survived**

---

## 🧠 Models Trained
- Two-Class Logistic Regression
- Two-Class Decision Forest

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing
- Removed unnecessary columns (Name, Ticket, Cabin)
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Split data into training and test sets (80/20)

---

## 📈 Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: **0.67**
- Decision Forest Accuracy: *(to be updated)*

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Azure Machine Learning
- Binary Classification
- Python
- GitHub

---

## 📸 Project Workflow
*(Screenshots of Azure ML pipeline and evaluation metrics will be added)*

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering
- Try boosted decision trees
- Compare models using AUC
